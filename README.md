# WebSearchEngine
We have developed a Web Search Engine in java by using the data structures and algorithms by which search can be performed optimally.<br>
Search engine is able to:

  1) Crawl through URLs.
  2) Parse the information in those URLs.
  3) Index the pages.
  4) Yield relevant search results.

## Algorithms and Methodologies used:

### Web Crawler
  > JSOUP (HTML DOM Element Selector)<br>
  > HashSet (to Store Crawled URL)
### Parser
  > JSOUP (HTML to TXT)
### Indexer
  > TST (Ternary Search Trie)<br>
  > Search Result Ranking (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency)
### Spell Corrector
  > Edit Distance Algorithm
